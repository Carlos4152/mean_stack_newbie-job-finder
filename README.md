# Newbie Job Finder

In the project, I designed and built a full-stack web application to challenge myself and understand how everything works in the backend. The application features a comprehensive job application tracking system, user authentication, and profile management. Here's a detailed breakdown of my contributions:

### 1. Frontend Development:

- **Design:** Created the user interface using Figma.
- **Implementation:** Developed the front end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness.
- **Dynamic Interactions:** Implemented dynamic features using Angular 16.

### 2. Backend Development:

- **Server Setup:** Used Node.js and Express.js to build the server and handle routing.
- **Database Management:** Utilized MongoDB and Mongoose for database operations.
- **Authentication:** Implemented user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

### 3. User Features:

- **Login and Registration:** Built secure user login and registration forms with input error verification.
- **Dashboard Access:** Added form controllers and security measures to authorize access to the dashboard for registered users only.
- **Job Application Tracking:** Enabled users to track their job applications, view previous applications, and delete them if necessary.
- **User Profile Management:** Developed a user profile section where customers can enter personal information and upload photos using Angular Reactive Forms and Cloudinary for image storage.
- **Search Functionality:** Implemented a search bar allowing users to search for jobs by title and location.

### Tools Used:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Angular 16
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JSON Web Token (JWT)
- **Others:** Figma for design, Git and GitHub for version control, and VSCode as the development environment.
