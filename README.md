I identify as a Front End Software Engineer with a passion for continuous learning and project development to enhance my skills further. While I currently excel in Front End development, my ambition is to transition into a Fullstack Software Engineer role. I am fully aware that achieving this goal requires dedicated efforts in building comprehensive Fullstack applications.
